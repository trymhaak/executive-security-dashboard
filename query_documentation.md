```kusto
SecurityIncident
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by IncidentNumber
| count
```

**Explanation:**
- Retrieves all security incidents from the last 30 days
- Takes the most recent record for each incident (using `arg_max`)
- Counts the total number of unique incidents

**Recharts Component:** Static text display (no chart component needed)

### 2. High Severity Incidents Card

**Query:**
```kusto
SecurityIncident
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where Severity == "High"
| summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by IncidentNumber
| count
```

**Explanation:**
- Filters security incidents from the last 30 days
- Further filters to only include high severity incidents
- Takes the most recent record for each incident
